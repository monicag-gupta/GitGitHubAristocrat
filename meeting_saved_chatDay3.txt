	I currently use stash mainly for two things:
	When you need to switch branch but you have changes. So you save them and then you can go back and restore them and continue working
	Imagine you as developer want to save some code to apply it sometimes but you don‚Äôt want to commit it or push it to the source code because it is not production code, it is code specific to your environment that you must not push
