22:10:31 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	git blame shows you:	Line-by-line changes of a file	Who made each change	When they made it	What the commit hash was
22:12:15 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	Limit to specific lines	git blame -L 5,8 index.html	This shows blame info for lines 5 to 8 only.	Ignore whitespace-only changes	git blame -w index.html	This ignores commits where only whitespace was changed, like indentation or trailing spaces.	Blame since a specific revision	git blame HEAD~2 index.html	Only shows blame starting from 2 commits ago.	Reverse blame (experimental)	git blame --reverse HEAD~3..HEAD index.html	Shows the first commit that added lines in that range (not who last modified them). Useful to trace origin.	Only show lines changed by a specific author	git blame --author="Monica Gupta" index.html	Shows only the lines where Monica Gupta is the last person to touch them.
22:13:11 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	Show commits in raw format (with filenames)	git blame --porcelain index.html	Outputs detailed blame info in a parseable format ‚Äî great for scripting.	See commits affecting a function (code)	For code (e.g., .js, .py), this works better:	git blame -L :someFunction:script.js	Tip: Combine with git show or git log	Take a hash from git blame output:	git log --oneline	git show 2039eaa 	To see the exact commit that introduced that change.
22:14:06 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	1. One-line summary of commits	git log --oneline	2. Visualize branch history	git log --oneline --graph --all	Visualizes branching and merging history using ASCII art.	3. Filter by author	git log --author="Monica Gupta"	Shows only commits made by Monica Gupta.	4. Show commits affecting a specific file	git log index.html	Great for tracing the history of a specific file.	5. Show changed files in each commit	git log --stat	This adds a summary of what files changed and how many lines were added or removed.
22:14:26 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	6. Filter by date	git log --since="2025-04-01"	Or:	git log --after="2025-04-01" --before="2025-04-05"	7. Show full patch (diff) with each commit	git log -p	Each commit includes the actual line-by-line changes made.	8. Custom format output	git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"	Shows: Short hash, Author name, How long ago, Commit message
22:15:19 From Monica Gupta to Everyone:
	git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
